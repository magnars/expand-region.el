;;; Commentary:


;; Idiomatic ruby has a lot of nested blocks, and its function marking seems a bit buggy.

;; Expansions:

;;  er/mark-ruby-block
;;  er/mark-ruby-function

;;; Code:
(defun er/mark-ruby-block ()
  (interactive)
  (ruby-beginning-of-block)
  (set-mark (point))
  (ruby-end-of-block)
  (end-of-line)
  (exchange-point-and-mark))

(defun er/mark-ruby-function ()
  "Mark the current Ruby function."
  (interactive)
  (condition-case nil
      (forward-char 3)
    (error nil))
  (word-search-backward "def")
  (while (er--point-inside-string-p)
    (word-search-backward "def"))
  (set-mark (point))
  (ruby-end-of-block)
  (end-of-line)
  (exchange-point-and-mark))


(defun er/add-ruby-mode-expansions ()
  "Adds Ruby-specific expansions for buffers in ruby-mode"
  (set (make-local-variable 'er/try-expand-list) (append
                                                  er/try-expand-list
