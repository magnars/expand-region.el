;;; Commentary:

;; There is no need for a er/mark-python-defun since
;; er/mark-python-block will mark it

;; Feel free to contribute any other expansions for Python at
;;
;;     https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el

;;; Bugs:

;; Doesn't properly handle triple quoted strings -- need to patch or
;; replace regular er/mark-inside-pairs since it marks inside the
;; outermost pair of quotes.

;;; Code:

(defun er/mark-python-statement ()
  "Marks one Python statement, eg. x = 3"
  (interactive)
  (er--setup)
  (python-end-of-statement)
  (set-mark (point))
  (python-beginning-of-statement))

(defun er/mark-python-block ()
  "Marks one Python block, eg. if x==3: return 'A'"
  (interactive)
  (er--setup)
  (python-mark-block))

(defun er/add-python-mode-expansions ()
  "Adds Python-specific expansions for buffers in python-mode"
  (set (make-local-variable 'er/try-expand-list) (append
                                                  er/try-expand-list
                                                  '(er/mark-python-statement
                                                    er/mark-python-block))))
